INFO:

Here are some system sounds I made to supplement the Gaia09 experience.
With cool themes you've just got to have cool sounds as well, right? So.

ENJOY! MOAR?

If you're on Windows, just go to the Control Panel and change sounds from
there. It would be a good idea to copy the whole Gaia09 SS folder into the
"Media" directory [found in the "Windows" directory] just so you don't
accidentally delete it or something. If you're on OS X, you'll figure it out. ;)
